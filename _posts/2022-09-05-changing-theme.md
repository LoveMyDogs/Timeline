# Changing my Theme: Errors and Successes

## The Results

### The Successes

- First down the line, all of my pages seemed to be working(jupyter, markdown, and docx posts all functioned well)
Evidence:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ipynb-bash-working-1.png "This shows my bash page functioning after changing to midnight theme")
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ipynb-working-2.png "This shows my python lists page functioning after changing to midnight theme")
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/markdown-working-0.png "This shows my markdown page functioning after changing to midnight theme")
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/docx-working-0.png "This shows my docx page functioning after changing to midnight theme")

### The Issues

- The things that did seem to break are the icons on top and my "_pages" section no longer showing, as in there was no longer a way to search, look at tags, etc.
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/home-page-0.png "This shows most of my homepage functioning however the upper right section"_pages" is no longer there")

- Overall it was a success :D
