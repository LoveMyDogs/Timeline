# The Process I'll be Following

After watching the video assigned I took in 3 main points, that I have noticed some deficits in, in my daily life


## Daily Happiness

From now I'm going to try doing things on the daily that are statistically proven to make people happy. I know it won't exactly be easy or make me happy right away, but I'll try to build the situation like a muscle as she said. There are several hobbies I could indulge in that I am thinking of doing for this, including some writing, but I'm hoping to pick up more ideas along the way


## Socializing

I've always been an introvert, but I think I'll try to attempt to talk to more people and form more connections, build a supportive community around myself. I've already sent appreciative messages to several of my friends, although I do that often anyhow, and I'll try to make my life happier in that aspect.


## The Present Moment

I'll be trying to focus more on the present then the future. Even if an event that is fairly negative is happening in the moment, I'll try to do actions to minimize that instead of trying to avoid it by thinking of my potential future happiness. Instead of escaping, from now on I'll build every single moment to the best it can be.

## Note of Gratitude

I'm really extremely grateful to my mom for providing for me and taking care of me every day, and I am also grateful for a friend I have on campus that commiserates with me on school work and helps me when I'm confused with anything
