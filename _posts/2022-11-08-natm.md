# Exhibits I looked at

I only looked at exhibits for the compsci class because all my friends are in this class, I'm sad I didn't get to see Serafina's project, in apcomscia. Here are my pictures below

# First one I saw

They had a quiz that tested on your compsci knowledge, which had very nice graphics and looked very cool, I really liked it.

# Second One I saw

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/natm_2.jpg  "Lily's Group")
They had a page about crime and how prevalent it was in any area's, I really liked their quiz and the random facts section, as well as their use of API's. 

# Last One I Saw

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/natm_3.jpg  "Random Person's Group")
They had a score list and a game that was really cool to look at, I didn't really talk to them because I didn't know them and I have social anxiety, haha, well it looked really nice from what I saw in the background.
