# My Score

I got a 48/50, with one of those problems being from a stupid reading mistake and the other from me not understanding.

# Question 1

On this question I just saw C and instead of reading through each answer I just chose it immediately, the actual answer would be D, as it does multiply the result by 5 3 times

# Question 2

For this one I put myself into a circle of confusion, telling myself if there would be any output at all, which there is. The correct answer is c, because when x is negative is when y is there. yeah.

# Review

Thankfully I already knew a lot of these concepts and could use deductive reasoning for those I was hesitant about, I did have to look up some concepts but it ended up well.
