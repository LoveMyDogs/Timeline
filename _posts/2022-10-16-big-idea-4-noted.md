## Big Idea 4.1

- Computers have evolved a lot over time
- Computers are interconnected and it is a basis of how they work
- Routers were made to allow computers to connect to each other and work quickly
- Routers allow information to go from sender to receiver
- Packets are small amounts of data sent over a network, which include data, source information, and destination information
- Packets are sent by the sender and received by the receiver
- Computer systems are groups of computers working together
- Computer networks are a group of interconnected devices that send and receive data
- Packet switching is when a message/file is broken up into packets and sent in any order, then reassembled by the receiving device
- A path is the network between two computing devices, and is a sequence of directly connected computing devices
- Bandwidth (measured in bits per second (BPS)) is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time on a computer network
- A protocol is an agreed upon set of rules that packets work under
- Many different protocols all go through IP in sending information
- The IETF creates internet standards
- The network access layer is usually in hardware, and in most homes ethernet
- It delivers packets through it with the NIC
- The MAC is it's unique address
- Two different types of protocols, one being TCP and the other UDP, TCP is more thorough and correct but slow, while UDP is fast but can have errors
