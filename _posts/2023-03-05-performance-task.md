## Scoring on Student 1
I gave them a 6/6 while the grader gave them a 4/6
- Row 1: I gave them a 1 in this, because I believed it to have fulfilled all requirements (Input, program funcionality, output, purpose, and function), however the ap scorer said it did not have program purpose described, which I didn't see at first
- Row 2: I gave them a 1, because they had two code segments, a named list, and it shows what is in the list, in accordance with the ap exam
- Row 3: I gave them a 1, because I believed in their explanation of managing complexity, while the ap exam grader said that it could be handled equally well with another method of coding
- Row 4: I gave them the point because it has a procedure with parameters, that all function within the program, ap grader agreed
- Row 5: Gave them the the point, there is sequencing, an if statement, and a for loop, which fits the three requirements, and it is explained in detail
- Row 6: Rewarded them the points calls are described, with the conditions and outputs, and avoiding all the don'ts ap exam person agreed

## Scoring on Student 2
I gave them a 6/6 while the grader gave them a 6/6 too
- Row 1: I gave them a 1, because they showed the program running, and output as well as exampled, ap exam grader agreed
- Row 2: I gave them a 1, because they had two code segments, several named lists, and what the last does, ap exam grader agreed
- Row 3: I gave them a 1, because they showed the management of complexity of several items, how things could be added with no issue, and it is the easiest way to do it, ap grader agreed
- Row 4: I gave them the point because it has a procedure with parameters, and the use of this function, ap grader agreed
- Row 5: Gave them the the point, there is sequencing, an if statement, and a repeat loop, which fits the three requirements, and it is explained in detail, ap grader agreed
- Row 6: Had two different calls, with different arguments, an explanation is given on what they do, and it shows us the result, ap grader agreed
