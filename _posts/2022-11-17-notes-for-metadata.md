# Notes

Meta data is not in in the post, it is something that surrounds the post, that people know about it but it isn’t intrinsic to it’s being. (eg. my name is not in my body nor is it a part of my being, but it is data about me). 
Frontmatter is an example of metadata, like the top bar and saying the date when something was created, or saying is this or that. 
Liquid exists in the coding environment, and then once it reaches the browser it transforms into something else that is useful in browser. 
Liquid tells it in the function, and iteration, to repeat itself, and then it disappears once it finishes it’s job. 

Latter half is javascript

Have to use liquid with html probably, since it’s coding and we dont’ really have any other way to create
