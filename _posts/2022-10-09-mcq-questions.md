In this question I struggled a bit in understanding what was going on however after careful thought and a look through the options I understood, I am going to look more at this type of pseudo-code. 

## The Function and Purpose Quiz

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/mcq_function_purpose.png "The quiz on function and purpose, I got one question wrong")
In this quiz I got one question wrong, and I struggled a lot while doing it, however I did start understanding the concept more as I was doing it. I will show the question I got wrong below. 

### Individual Question
