    "# Model and Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "> Object Oriented Programming is a part of learning Python.  The objective of this blog is to introduce OOP with the intention of PBL task to create a database.  The foundations for a database is defining a Class and understanding instance data and methods.  A database is often a focus of backend coding as it will store persistent data, that can be recalled after the immediate session is closed.\n",
