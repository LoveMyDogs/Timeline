    "## Simulations\n",
    "Simulations is representing something in the real world, or a fictional scenario, and replicating it by making a program. This is useful in not endangering real people while testing dangerous. The retailer is the least useful one for that, you should just make an algorithm instead of a simulation with real people. Safety and efficacy of using the method are important. It can quickly do maths with an input so that you don't have to go through the same procedure several times. Video games and blender both have simulations, with object colliding and killing each other and i want to  kill myselfBlender simulates light and many mini simulations. "

When attacking or colliding with an enemy you get knocked back, as your attack expressed a force on them, and thus expressed a force on you back.
