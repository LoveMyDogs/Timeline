    "## Beneficial things\n",
    "1. Could reduce the stress and tire of students by making one thing easier for them\n",
    "2. Saves time for people who are busy with school or work\n",
    "3. Has an interface that could be used to gather data that is available to the people\n",
    "\n",
    "## Harmful thing\n",
    "I believe that our storing of data could be harmful, as you could potentially see the economic or social position of a person by the car they choose, and you could use this against them or to hurt htem\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pros and Cons\n",
    "I believe a pro of this could be controlling students to not be distracted, and making sure they are not doing dangerous things that could be potentially be used against the school, and a con is a lack of control in students, not allowing students to do things in classes like this, and limiting access to resources that could be used for school\n",
    "\n",
    "## Digital Divide\n",
    "I have pretty large concerns about digital divide, I feel that it shows another part of the growing inequality in the world, and this lack of resources gives yet another way for the rich to grow above those who are underprivileged. Personally I'm on a pretty good scale with pretty good resources, and hate that others can't have the same amount of stuff that I do."

    "The figure presents the graph of three circles, one small, one medium, and one large, in the first quadrant of a coordinate plane with the origin labeled O. The x and y axes each have the numbers 1 through 8 indicated.  The largest circle is centered at the coordinates 4 comma 4 and has a radius of 3 units. The medium size circle is centered at the coordinates 4 comma 3 and has a radius of 2 units. The smallest circle is centered at the coordinates 4 comma 2 and has a radius of 1 unit.\n",
