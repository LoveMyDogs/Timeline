<blockquote>
  <p>Doerfler and Moyn in the article “Why Liberals Need to Radically Change The Rules of Our Politics” argue that The Constitution is not what the United States of America should be witholden to, and as such we should use another system of government that discards it’s existence altogether. The authors then use their audience’s views in “liberalism” and abortion to argue that The Constitution is a block against progress and our society, and it is in our greatest interest to not have it control the country anymore. Afterwards, they propose their own system of government and law that would create equality between “high law” and everyday law, by ridding Congress of most of its powers and deciding everything by popular will. They support this system of government by stating it’s benefits and the possibility for change, while stating that it will create a more pure democracy in the USA. They also support their changes in Congress by comparing it to an already existing and performing system of Canada, showing real world applicable basis.</p>

  <p>I disagree with both of Doefler and Moyn’s points, their distaste for high law and the system of government that they proposed, due to the need of an immovable basis in modern society and my lack of faith in voter laws. In recent times there has been an undermining of decade long legislature and growing division within the country; additionally, I have seen many groups of people (eg. Neo Nazi’s) that claim slavery was not actually that bad and slave owners were innocent people of their time, therefore, at least right now, I could not see many democratic instituions keeping their hold. These factors make me hold high and immutable law with esteem, especially in the current political climate in the United States. I also believe that the method they spoke of for congress and popular will is not achievable especially when the Senate is still in power. I also believe this would not be a favorable plan of action because currently, senators do not actually represent popular will or the vast majority of the population. Without a check for the senate, without a popular vote that isn’t repressed, then this reality would not be as ideal as it is portrayed.</p>
