Print does not need to be a string file, can be + with other things in it, and several variables can also be used within them
Functions can create new commands and be used for things that will be repeated later on, see example in "doing my best"
If/else statements/conditionals are useful for user input, and making several different outputs when necessary
Variables can be changed and are useful for function commands or things that will be used in different circumstances and might be changed.
Bash can be used for automation of downloading files and using git, while also using terminal things
Images can be added to things with site.baseurl
Keys are things that allow code to see what it is and run back to that
